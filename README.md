## Introduction

The Image Slider project showcases an image slider that allows users to navigate through a collection of images using arrow buttons and pagination indicators. The project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Defines the structure of the slider.
- CSS: Styles the appearance of the slider and its components.
- JavaScript: Implements the interactive behavior of the slider.

## Usage

To use the Image Slider, simply open the `slide.html` file in a web browser. You'll see a set of arrow buttons on the sides of the slider to navigate between images. Additionally, there are pagination indicators at the bottom to help you easily jump to specific images.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project according to your preferences:

- **Images**: Replace the image URLs in the `slide.html` file with your own image URLs.
- **Styles**: Modify the styles in the `slide.css` file to change the appearance of the slider, buttons, and indicators.
- **Functionality**: Explore the `slide.js` file to understand and modify the behavior of the slider, such as transition speed, arrow icon styles, and more.
